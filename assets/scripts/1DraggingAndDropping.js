//drag and drop theory
/**
 * mark the element as "draggable" to true in the html code
 * list to a "dragstart" event; will be triggered when an element is dragged
 * mark an area where it is supposed to be dropped as "dragenter" and "dragover"; can omit the "dragenter"
 * must call prevent default because the default is that drag and drop doesn't work in the browser
 * listen to a "dragleave" event when the item is dragged away from the element it was dragged on
 * listen to drop event
 * can listen to "Dragend" event when element is dropped in invalid area
